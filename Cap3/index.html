        Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed through some interesting places on the way:
        <ol>
            <li>Walla Walla</li>
            <li>WA</li>
            <li>Magic City</li>
            <li>ID</li>
            <li>Bonuntiful</li>
            <li>UT</li>
            <li>Last Chance</li>
            <li>CO</li>
            <li>Why</li>
            <li>AZ and Truth or Consequences</li>
            <li>NM</li>

            
        </ol>
    </p>

        I saw some Burma Shave sytle signs on the side of the road today:
         <blockquote>
              Passing cars When you can't see, <br>
              May get you, <br>
              A glimpse, <br>
              Of eternity.
            </blockquote>
             I definitely won't be passing any cars.

        My first day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got everething packed and ready to go. Because I' m on a Segway,
        I Wasn't able to bring a whole lot whith me: 
        <ul>
        <li>cell phone</li>
        <li>ipod</li>
        <li>digital camera</li>
        <li>protein bar</li>
       </ul>
        Just the essentials. As Lao Tzu would have said, 
        <q>A journey of a thounsand miles begins with one Segway.</q>
